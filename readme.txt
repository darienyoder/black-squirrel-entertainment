!!! REMEMBER !!!

When you change the stylesheet, update the version at the top of the file and in header.php, otherwise it might not update on the site.
Test stylesheet changes in test.html before uploading them to avoid wasting time with multiple uploads.
The file manager plugin no longer allows direct file uploads. You must instead copy the text from the local file and paste it into the remote file editor.
